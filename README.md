# Hello, I'm Aliff 👋🏻

A digital experience creator leveraging AI to build meaningful applications without a traditional coding background.

## About Me

I combine modern development techniques with AI assistance to create functional, user-centered digital experiences that I also personally use day to day. My journey began in content writing ✍🏻, where I've contributed to content marketing projects across multiple industries since 2019, crafting over hundreds of high-quality content for clients worldwide.

Currently training to become a MOTAC-licensed tour guide in Penang (expected completion April 2025), which perfectly complements my technical work in developing applications for showcasing the beauty of the Pearl of the Orient 🌏 as well as Malaysia 🇲🇾. I'm also passionate about public transportation and have spent 2+ years contributing data for Moovit, helping improve transport data accuracy across Malaysia 🚌.
